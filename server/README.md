## Auth from scratch from CJ's coding garden    

##### Tech:
- Nodejs: Javascript engine for writing a web server on my computer
- Expressjs: Framework for Nodejs to write middle ware, write routes, etc.. 
- @hapi/joi: validation package
- monk: its like knex but for mongodb, easy way to talk to the db on your machine
- bcrypt: hashing package to keep passwords secret in your db
- volleyball: http logger that makes it easy to read/debug in the console as we work

#### Backend:
To start: navigate to ./server
- $ npm run dev (uses nodemon so i dont have to refresh)
- using postman to check apis
